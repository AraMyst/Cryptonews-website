      <h2>Cypher Protocol developer steals $300,000 from reimbursement fund</h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          A new scandal has arrived in the world of cryptocurrencies. This time, involving the Cypher Protocol, a decentralized project based on the Solana blockchain. One of its main developers, known by the pseudonym “Hoak”, publicly admitted to stealing more than $300,000 from the reimbursement fund intended to compensate users affected by a previous attack. Once again, questions about security and trust in cryptocurrency projects are on the table. 
        </p>
        <h3>The confession</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          That Tuesday, Hoak published a statement on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), confessing to the theft of funds from Cypher Protocol. In his statement titled “My statement on the situation”, he claimed that the accusations are true. His words were: “I took the funds and gambled them away. I didn’t run away with it, nor did anyone else.” Hoak expressed deep remorse for his actions, attributing his behaviour to untreated psychological issues, including severe gambling addiction.

        <h3>The consequences</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The theft was discovered when a user reported that they were unable to withdraw funds from their reimbursement wallet. When asked about the problem, Hoak initially stated that he would “take care of the issue”, but he never fulfilled his promise. Barrett, after checking, provided detailed information to police and collaborated with well-known blockchain investigator “ZachXBT”, who had obtained Hoak’s personal data during the investigation into the August 2023 hack. ZachXBT promised to share this information with authorities as necessary.
        </p>
        <h3>The future of the Cypher Protocol</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          The path ahead for Cypher Protocol remains uncertain. The team proposed many preventative measures, including stricter security audits, better internal controls, and reducing the anonymity of cryptocurrency project founders. These measures are important to restore user confidence and prevent future incidents of theft and misuse of funds. Hoak, for his part, has stated his intention to face legal consequences for his actions, acknowledging that he will likely face a prison sentence.
